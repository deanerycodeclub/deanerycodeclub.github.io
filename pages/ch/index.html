      <p>So, all those crazy people (and robots!) above are all the playable charcters in Overwatch. There are many of them, all with varying skills, abilities and health. My top 3 favourite hero list
      would have to go like this:<ol>
        <li>Soldier 76 (the guy holding a gun to the left of the big robot a few characters from the right)</li>
        <li>Genji (the ninja robot on the very left)</li>
        <li>Reinhardt (the huge suit of armour with a hammer)</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p>My favourite game mode is Competitive Play. In CP, you can go up the ranks in SR (skill rating) and become a better player. The higher your SR, the better you are and the haredr the people you play against are. My SR is currently 1900! Also0, Competitive Play gives you more XP than usual, ahich is important to me because I love getting to higher XP levels. Once you get to le vel 100, you become "prestage". I am currently prestage 1 level 14. In other words level 114!</p>
