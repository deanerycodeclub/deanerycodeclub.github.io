      <p>So, all those crazy people (and robots!) above are all the playable charcters in Overwatch. There are many of them, all with varying skills, abilities and health. My top 3 favourite hero list
      would have to go like this:<ol>
        <li>Soldier 76 (the guy holding a gun to the left of the big robot a few characters from the right)</li>
        <li>Genji (the ninja robot on the very left)</li>
        <li>Reinhardt (the huge suit of armour with a hammer)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>My favourite game mode is Competitive Play. In CP, you can go up the ranks in SR (skill rating) and become a better player. The higher your SR, the better you are and the harder the people you play against are. My SR is currently 1900! Also, Competitive Play gives you more XP than usual, which is important to me because I love getting to higher XP levels. Once you get to level 100, you become "prestiged". I am currently prestige 1 level 14. In other words level 114!</p>
      <p> So yeah! I hope you enjoyed reading about Overwatch, it is really fun to play and has constant updates. Thanks for reading!</p>
