    <h1>My Love Of Football:</h1>
  
    <p>Hi! I'm Charlie and I attend Code Club, a place where you can make 
    games and websites. Hopefully, you'll love my website page.</p>
    <p>My favourite football player of all time has to be Pelé. In my opinion, he is the best player of all-time. Some may argue that Maradona is the best ever,
    however who has won 3 world cups? Also, Pelé stayed devoted to his boyhood club for years and years. 
    <p>My favourite current footballer is Lionel Messi. Down below  is a pic of him: </p>

    You can see him holding the most prized  individual possession in the world, the Ballon do'r, which you only get if you are the best footballer in the world.
    <p>Aside from football, I also enjoy watching wrestling. My favourite wrestler has to be Mick Foley.
    I like him as he was VERY hardcore and always took risks. Plus, he had legendary matches with the likes of the Undertaker,
    The Rock, John Cena, Triple H, Chris Jericho, Ric Flair and many other greats.
    He is a multi-time world-champion, winning the title on 4 occasions, with 3 of the reigns with WWE and one with TNA.
    He has also been an 11 time tag team champion, with eight WWE reigns and 3 ECW reigns.
    He has held the hardcore championship, capping off a distinguished career.
   He has wrestled for numerous promotions, including WWE,ECW,WCW and TNA.</p>
   Down below is a picture of him: <img src="http://www.realmickfoley.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/foley-250x200.png"
